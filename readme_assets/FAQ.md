# FAQ

1. Why Facet?<br/>
Facet abstracts the rollout mechanism that used to be achieved by using feature flags. At facet, we believe that engineers shouldn't spend their time maintaining manual configurations that come along with feature flags. We enable engineers to focus on building the future, while we build the rollout mechanisms which offer rollout abstractions.

2. What is a facet? <br/>
A facet is a set elements that construe a feature. For instance, a login form could be considered a facet, with the elements being `username` and `password`.

3. How to hide a facet before rolling out to production?<br/>
Currently this is not possible, but we are working on adding this *important feature* soon!

4. Can I declare facets within backend technologies? <br/>
Not yet. Our team is working hard to offer facet declaration for backend systems. We will be soon launching a pilot, initially we are targeting java as the piloting language. However, we are planning to open source the API, so that affiliating SDKs can be implemented from devs.

5. Is facet secure? <br/>
At facet, Security is one of the main pillars of our culture. We have integrated with multiple vendors who champion DevSecOps, including [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [Github](https://github.com/dependabot), to ensure secure codebases. We are also working on getting ISO, HIIPA and other security licenses.

6. Is facet open source? <br/>
Currently, facet-extension is open source. We believe in open source and we plan to open source many of our systems as they become mature and ready for the public.
